# Garbage in, Garbage out
* Machine Learning models are not smart per se

* Simple algorithms can outperform more complex ones if trained on enough high quality data

* Incorrect, inconsistent, biased data leads to wrong conclusions

* The implications are serious

# Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)

Measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

![](img/df-head.png)
Answers to 25 questions from 1259 respondents.

# Step 1: from messy data to tidy data

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping a dataset to its structure:
* Each variable/feature forms a column
* Each observation forms a row
* Each type of observational unit forms a table

### What is data quality?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality) general definition:

* it's fit for its intended use
* it correctly represents the reality to which it refers

--

State of completeness, consistency, timeliness, duplication and accuracy that makes data appropriate for a specific use

Missing data are data points for which the type is known but not the values, e.g. an unanswered questions in a survey

<!-- Mechanisms for missing data: -->

* Missing Completely At Random (`MCAR`):
<br>.example[some people don't fill in surveys on mental health]
<!-- the reasons for a value being missing are independent of any observable or non observable variable -->

* Missing At Random (`MAR`): 
<!-- missingness is not random but can be fully explained by some variable for which the information available is complete -->
<br>.example[_men are less likely to fill in surveys on mental health for no other reason then being men_]

* Missing Not At Random (`MNAR`): 
<!-- missingness is due to unknown factors -->
<br>.example[_men are less likely to fill in surveys on mental health because of mental health somehow_]

### Deletion

* Large number of missing values in a column values are missing
* Few missing values and **not** at random

### Imputation

* **Numerical** imputation: replace all missing observations with a single value, usually the mean
* **Random selection** from the distribution
* **Hot deck** imputation: missing values are imputed from similar records in the dataset
* **KNN** imputation: determine the the nearest neighbors and use some aggregate of their values to impute the missing one

**Inspection**<br>
Detect unexpected, incorrect, and inconsistent data (Data profiling and Visualization)

**Cleaning**<br>
Remove, Correct or Impute incorrect data

**Verifying**<br>
Is the data correct now? Re-inspect and test to verify no assumptions are violated

**Reporting**<br>
Keep a log of the inconsistencies and errors found and how they were addressed

Make sure every step is documented and reproducible

Avoid manual edits!

# Epilogue

* This is not an exhaustive guide to pre-processing

* Many decision steps and possible failure points

* This stuff ain't easy

* It's important that models are trained on data that is reliable, consistent and unbiased
